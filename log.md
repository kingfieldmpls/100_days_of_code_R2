## #100daysofcode Round 2

### R2D1 | Sunday, June 16th 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Finished reading my log from the last round of 100 days of code
* Setup a 100 days of code tracker on the PyBites platform
* Installed VS Code
* Watched Corey Schaefer's VS Code video

**Thoughts**

* In some ways it seems I've come so far, and in others it seems like I knew things then that I don't remember anymore, or questions I had then are still questions I have now
* Still super motivated and excited
* Still need to focus and not try to take on machine learning, visualization, IoT and a million other directions

---

* You can see the brain dump above, but basically my focus this time is to work on web development
* Here are my main goals:
 * Complete the Talk Python training #100daysofcode course
 * Complete the Talk Python training #100daysofweb course
 * Complete Intermediate PyBites challenges
 * Code using VS Code
 * Get a Martin app to functioning status on a web platform
 * Improve Git knowledge and efficiency
