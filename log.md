## #100daysofcode Round 2

### R2D1 | Sunday, June 16th 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Finished reading my log from the last round of 100 days of code
* Setup a 100 days of code tracker on the PyBites platform
* Installed VS Code
* Watched Corey Schaefer's VS Code video

**Thoughts**

* In some ways it seems I've come so far, and in others it seems like I knew things then that I don't remember anymore, or questions I had then are still questions I have now
* Still super motivated and excited
* Still need to focus and not try to take on machine learning, visualization, IoT and a million other directions

---

* You can see the brain dump above, but basically my focus this time is to work on web development
* Here are my main goals:
 * Complete the Talk Python training #100daysofcode course
 * Complete the Talk Python training #100daysofweb course
 * Complete Intermediate PyBites challenges
 * Code using VS Code
 * Get a Martin app to functioning status on a web platform
 * Improve Git knowledge and efficiency

### R2D2 | Monday, June 17th 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed bite 47 using VS code
* Reviewing where I left off in Talk Python #100daysofcode training
 * Github api introduced some foggy concepts
  * requests-cache
  * pdb
  * Jupyter notebooks

**Thoughts**

* It took me a second to rememeber vs code concepts from last night. Practice will be good. Could rewatch Corey's video and of course reviewing the documentation would be great.
* I should just start at day 61 again because I think I missed some crucial steps
* There are 71 more intermedite bites, so I have my work cut out for me to complete all of thos alongside my other goals

### R2D3 | Wednesday, June 19th 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed the first day of #100daysofcode Github API
* Re-famaliarized myself with Jupyter and it's shortcuts
* Setup environment variables for pipenv through a .env file
* Setup specific kernels in Jupyter
* Gained a better conception of how use pdb can help you discover the output of an API interactively

**Thoughts**

* The hours still absolutely whip by

**Questions**

* Why did Jupyter have access to my pipenv modules even when I was just in the regular python3 kernel?
